Comments:
---------

problem 5-1, server based architecture does mean separate services, but they
   are usually part of a single server application.  Still, close enough.

problem 5-8, I don't see your state machine diagram for this...

problem 6-2, the subclass arrows should point the other way.  Text is not a
   subclass of line, it should associate directly with drawable.  Fillable
   should be a subclass of LineDrawable.

Not too bad of a job, if you had done the state machine diagram...
