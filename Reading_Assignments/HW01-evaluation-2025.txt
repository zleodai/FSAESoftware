Comments:
---------

On problem 4.2, the critical path is actually G, D, E, M, and Q.  You look to
   see the longest SEQUENTIAL path through the graph.  The longest duration
   task is G, and that task is followed by one of L, D, or O.  L and D both
   have the same duration which is longer than O so it must be one of them.
   You then look to see what follows L and D, which is K and E.  The total
   duration for G, D, E is 19 which is longer than G, L, K at 17.  From E,
   you then go to M and then to Q for a total of 32.

On problem 5.3, there are a couple of your answers which are inconsistent
   with the book's answers.  It should be:
      B, U&F, U&F, U&F, N, N, N, N, N, F, F, U&F, U&F, U&F, U&F, U&F
   pretty close, though...


Good job!!
