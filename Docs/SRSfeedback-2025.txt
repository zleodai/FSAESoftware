COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Not required for this semester's exercise

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   This is the same document as last semester.  You were supposed to update
   it with requirements for what you will be adding this semester.  I don't
   see anything different in a binary comparison of the requirements from
   these two repositories.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   These are excellent!  Good job on this section, nothing else needed.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   These are find, too.  Good job on this section, nothing else needed.

Since you don't have the updated requirements for this semester's work, I'm
can only give you 1/2 credit for this deliverable.
