Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Trackside Car Software
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   This is the same document as last semester.  You were supposed to update
   the document with an explanation of what you got done last time and what
   you're planning this time.  Just copy/pasting the same document is NOT
   what was required.  Sorry.

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   Very nice work on the updated presentation.  You have clearly defined the
   activities you'll be adding.  The graphics are pretty good, and you are
   telling a story with the way the slide data are arranged so you keep the
   audience engaged.  You all did a pretty good job of maintaining eye
   contact with the audience, too.

Summary:
--------
Total:  3% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Be sure you are reading the requirements for the deliverables CAREFULLY so
you will know what you're supposed to be doing for each one.
