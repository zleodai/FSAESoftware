Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4071 Fall 2024
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   This is amazing!  You have completely detailed all the parts for your
   software and they are logically and clearly laid out.  Obviously you
   have 'done your homework' on this.....

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Here again this section is looking very good.  Remember, though, that
   each requirement should be a single statement.  If you have multiple
   sentences in a numbered requirement, that shows you that there are at
   minimum a requirement statement and a 'will' statement, or possibly
   even two or three requirement statements.  For example:

      5.3.1.2.1 The Database shall store real-time telemetry data
                The Database will securely store real-time telemetry data
                received from the vehicle, ensuring minimal data loss
                during transmission.
                Minimal data loss will be defined as being no more than one
                bit of every 100,000 bits transferred.
   Next, watch the 'weasel words':

      5.3.1.2.2 The Database shall support wireless data transmission.

   What do you mean by 'support'?  How does a database engine 'support' any
   transmission ~ isn't that the job of the networking hardware?

   Last item: since you are using numbered requirements, NO BULLETS on the
   requirement statements.  The numbers are enough, especially if you use
   'hanging indents'...

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   This section has the right language for 'shall' statements, and has the
   appropriate level of detail.  Good work.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:

Great job!  Clean up those requirements as noted above by the end of the
semester for full credit on this document.  Keep it up!
