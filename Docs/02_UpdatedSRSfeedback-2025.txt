   see anything different in a binary comparison of the requirements from
   these two repositories.

COMMENTS:
---------
There are no updates to your original SRS as you were supposed to do.  There
   also is no updated or new development schedule, which I would think you
   might want to have, so you can track your progress, right?  ;)
