Project Proposal Feedback
Project: FSAE Formula SAE Car Software
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
The document covers all the bases.  You provide good outlines of what you
want the software to accomplish, along with the hardware and what it will
be used for in the design.  The separation of concerns looks good.

The justification speeks well to the integration of your knowledge and
interests and provides a good overview of what technologies and software
languages you will need.  Very nice work, but then you've had a while to
get this ironed out, right?  :D

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
Nice presentation, skillfully done.  Everyone had a part, and it seemed
that everyone was able to answer any of the questions that arose.


Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.
