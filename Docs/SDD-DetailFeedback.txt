==========================================

DETAILED CSC AND CSU DESCRIPTIONS:
   Descriptions are done in the next section.
   Good enough on this section ~ nothing to add here.

DETAILED CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:
   Very nice work on this section and it subsumes the previous section as
   well.  Nothing to add here.

DETAILED INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Excellent job on this section ~ nothing to add here.

DETAILED DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Excellent job on this section ~ nothing to add here.

DETAILED DESIGN DIAGRAMS:
   No diagrams in any of the sections of the detailed design.  You should at
   least have an Entity-Relationship Diagram [ERD] for your database, but a
   use case, activity, state, and/or sequence diagram elsewhere would be very
   helpful to the readers' understanding.  Think about that for next time.

DATABASE DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION:
   This really should be an "Entity-Relationship Diagram" or "ERD".  However
   since we are close to the end of the semester, I'm not going to make you
   do this part again.  The verbal descriptions are pretty good, since you
   talk about what the entities [tables] will be.

   Are you sure that database security will not be an issue?  What happens
   if another race team is able to corrupt your wifi connection and slip in
   bogus data to your telemetry stream?  Will the driver end up being told
   to steer the car into a wall?  Just a thought...

Overall, you have done a very nice job on this document.  It's clear that it
describes the system well and that you care about the engineering craft, even
if you haven't followed the details of the specification for the document, so
I'm bumping the score up by 20% to a 93.33%.
